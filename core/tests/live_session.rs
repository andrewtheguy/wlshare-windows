//! A session against a real wlshare, which no unit test can stand in for: the
//! handshake, the ZRLE and VP9 streams, the cursor, the density extension, the
//! clipboard and the sound all only exist between two processes.
//!
//! Ignored by default and pointed at `WLSHARE_TEST_SERVER`, or `127.0.0.1:5900`,
//! as `WLSHARE_TEST_USERNAME` with `WLSHARE_TEST_PASSWORD`, or unauthenticated
//! when there is none. The core has nothing Windows in it, so these run from
//! the Linux checkout against the wlshare of the session they run in:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test --test live_session -- --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1
//! ```
//!
//! They resize the desktop they talk to, so point them at one nobody is using.
