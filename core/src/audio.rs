//! The desktop's sound, between the session that decodes it and the Windows
//! audio device that plays it.
//!
//! The session asks for one format — signed 16-bit stereo at 48 kHz, the rate
//! a Windows output mixes at by default, and one the audio engine converts from
//! when a device runs at another — and decodes every FLAC frame into
//! [`Playback`] as it arrives. The device takes
//! from it on its own clock, in whatever sizes it likes, and neither waits for
//! the other: the lock is held for one copy.
//!
//! The two clocks are not the same clock, and the network between them is not
//! smooth, so the buffer has a floor and a ceiling. It starts playing only
//! once [`START`] is waiting, which absorbs the jitter of frames arriving in
//! bursts behind a big framebuffer update; running dry puts it back to waiting
//! for that much, rather than playing each frame the instant it lands and
//! stuttering on every one. Past [`CEILING`] the oldest sound is thrown away,
//! down to [`START`], so a stall that is followed by a burst costs a skip and
//! not a permanent delay.
