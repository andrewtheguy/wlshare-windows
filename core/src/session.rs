//! One connection, from the TCP handshake to the socket closing.
//!
//! This is the daemon's `session.rs` read backwards. It runs on its own thread,
//! on a current-thread tokio runtime, and it owns everything about the wire; the
//! window owns nothing but pixels it reads under a lock and events it posts to a
//! channel. The two never block each other for longer than a memcpy.
//!
//! What it speaks, and why:
//!
//! - **ZRLE**, on one inflate stream for the whole connection, decoded straight
//!   into the framebuffer. Raw is listed too because the server sends it before
//!   the first `SetEncodings` and there is no arranging otherwise.
//! - **The server's own pixel format.** Asking for `XRGB8888` is asking for the
//!   framebuffer's bytes as they are, which is also what the window's bitmap
//!   reads; no pixel is swizzled anywhere between the compositor and the screen.
//! - **Cursor and Cursor With Alpha**, because captured frames have no pointer
//!   painted in them and a client that does not draw one has no pointer at all.
//! - **Fence and ContinuousUpdates**, so frames arrive as the desktop changes
//!   with one update in flight, rather than one round trip per frame.
//! - **The density extension**, which is what the window's 1×/2× is: the window
//!   says what scale the desktop should be drawn at, the server draws it at that
//!   scale, and `SetDesktopSize` asks for a framebuffer the size of the window in
//!   device pixels. The picture is then one device pixel per framebuffer pixel
//!   and never resampled, at either scale.
//!
//! - **Extended Clipboard**, text as UTF-8, both ways, and the only clipboard
//!   there is: a latin-1 cut text is dropped. A change on the desktop is
//!   notified, asked for at once and handed to the window; the window's text
//!   is notified when the window gives it, and sent when the desktop asks.
//!
//! - **The audio extension**, when the window asked for sound: listed, and
//!   answered with a format and an enable once the server announces it. Each
//!   FLAC frame is decoded as it arrives, on this thread, into the
//!   [`Playback`] the Windows audio device takes from. Asked for and not
//!   announced is a server with no sound to give, and the session runs silent.
//!
//! The camera, the microphone and output selection are not spoken. Their
//! pseudo-encodings are not listed, so the server never offers them.
