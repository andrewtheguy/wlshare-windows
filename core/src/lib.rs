//! The wlshare client, everything but the window.
//!
//! The Windows app owns a window, a Win2D canvas and the events WinUI hands it.
//! This crate owns everything else: the socket, the RFB session, the decoders,
//! the framebuffer they write into, and the tables that say what a Windows key
//! or a wheel step is on the wire. Nothing here knows what WinUI is, which is
//! what lets all of it be tested on a machine that has never seen it.
//!
//! [`Client::connect`] starts a thread with a current-thread tokio runtime on
//! it and returns at once; the session runs there until it ends or the client
//! is dropped. The window learns there is something new from the callback given
//! to [`Client::on_frame`] and reads the pixels through [`Client::with_frame`],
//! which holds the framebuffer's lock for exactly as long as the upload takes.
//!
//! The desktop's sound, when the window asked for it, is decoded into a
//! buffer the Windows audio device takes from through [`Client::read_audio`],
//! on its own clock.
//!
//! **Scope.** The screen — as wlshare's VP9 stream or as exact ZRLE,
//! whichever the window chose — the keyboard, the pointer, the desktop's scale — 1×
//! or 2×, chosen by the window — the clipboard, as text both ways, and the
//! desktop's sound. The camera, the microphone and picking an output are
//! wlshare extensions this client does not list, so the server never sends
//! them.
